This repository outlines payroll document requirements for paystubs and W-2s.

## Feature Overview
- Generate paystub PDFs per payroll run with earning codes, taxes, deductions, PTO balances, and YTD totals.
- Provide an employee portal for secure, logged access to historical paystubs.
- Implement W-2 generation using stored annual totals with admin downloads and employee self-service access.

See [`docs/payroll_features.md`](docs/payroll_features.md) for detailed requirements covering document content, delivery, security, and compliance expectations.
